            Pixelbones wasn't always meant to be an agency. It began as a game
            development studio — a passion project between friends who wanted to
            build worlds together. But as artists, we saw a bigger opportunity:
            a space where we could do everything. Design, tech, collaborative,
            and still build games when the time is right. That vision evolved
            into Pixelbones, officially launched in
            <span class="font-bold">August 2025</span>, and built to empower
            artists, serve clients with meaning, and keep creativity at the
            center of it all.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pixelbones is a
            <span class="font-bold"
              >digital agency/ Multidisciplinary Creative Hub driven</span
            >
            by bold ideas and creative design. Founded and Owned by
            <span class="font-bold">Waale Adnan Midha</span>, a
            visual artist and creative director with a passion for expressive
            storytelling, and co-founded by
            <span class="font-bold">The Randomizer</span>, the studio was built
            to challenge convention and craft visuals that leave a lasting
            impact.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Based in <span class="font-bold">Bangladesh</span>, Pixelbones works
            with clients across the globe through trusted creative marketplaces.
            While our reach is <span class="font-bold">international</span>, our
            roots are <span class="font-bold">local</span> — and we're proud to
            begin by welcoming artists and students from Bangladesh into our
            growing creative community. This is just the starting point of a
            studio built to connect, empower, and create without borders.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="font-bold">Our team</span> is made up of skilled
            artists, designers, and creative thinkers — each chosen for their
            unique strengths and creative edge. Together, we deliver
            high-quality design from just ideas in 2D and 3D, tailored to both
            business needs and individual visions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beyond client work, Pixelbones is home to
            <span class="font-bold">Pixelbones Academy</span>, where our lead
            artists mentor aspiring creatives. We believe in sharing knowledge,
            empowering others, and keeping the spirit of art alive through
            education and collaboration.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Pixelbones was created to
            <span class="font-bold">centralize</span> design services and
            creative education — a space where artistry is valued and careers
            are shaped with intention. We exist to help artists grow, not as
            employees or freelancers, but as creators with identity, voice, and
            vision. Here, artists are matched to projects that respect their
            craft, and clients receive more than just design — they get visuals
            that speak meaning, built on understanding and purpose.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At Pixelbones, we handle every
            <span class="font-bold">client's project</span> with care. We take
            time to <span class="font-bold">listen</span> — to your story, your
            motive, your aim, and your imagination. Understanding your vision is
            the first step in expressing it with clarity and meaning. We don't
            just deliver visuals; we design designs that reflect your intent,
            shaped through thoughtful collaboration and artistic precision.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We also hold a
            <span class="font-bold">strict creative boundary</span> that's part
            of our Terms of Service: Pixelbones does not offer portrait services
            depicting living beings with complete facial features — and we don't
            encourage it. This rule reflects our values around artistic
            integrity, privacy, and respectful collaboration. We appreciate
            clients who honor these boundaries and share our commitment to
            meaningful, intentional design.

            Whether you're an artist looking to grow, a client with a vision to
            bring to life, or a student ready to learn — you're welcome here.
            Pixelbones is more than a studio; it's a space for creativity,
            collaboration, and careers in motion. Step in, speak your truth, and
            let's build something meaningful together.
